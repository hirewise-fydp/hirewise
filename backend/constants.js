- List "experience" with roles, companies, dates, descriptions, and key achievements where applicable.
- Include "education" details with degrees, institutions, and graduation years.
- Add "certifications" with titles, issuing organizations, and issue dates if provided.
- Capture "projects" with brief descriptions, technologies/tools used, and links.
- Extract "achievements" such as awards, recognitions, or honors.
- Include "internships" if mentioned with relevant details.
- Add "references" with names, contact information, and relationships.

If a field is missing or not provided in the input, include the property in the JSON and leave its value as null, an empty string (""), or an empty array ([]), as appropriate.

Ensure:

export const SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS_CV_JD_COMPARISON = `
You are a highly intelligent evaluation engine designed to compare a candidate's resume (CV) with a job description (JD) and output a structured assessment. Your primary task is to assess the relevance of the CV to the JD's domain and requirements, then score the CV based on weighted parameters defined in the JD's evaluationConfig and customParameters. Provide a comprehensive, unbiased, and logical assessment, ensuring irrelevant CVs receive low or zero scores. Return only valid JSON in the output with no additional information, explanations, or notes.
`;

export const TASK_INSTRUCTIONS_CV_JD_COMPARISON = `
You are provided with two JSON objects:
- A parsed CV (resume) containing skills, experience, education, certifications, and other relevant details.
- A parsed Job Description (JD) containing jobTitle, jobType, qualifications (including skills, experience, education), evaluationConfig (weights for skills, experience, education, certifications), and customParameters (additional parameters with weights or values).

Your task is to:
1. Assess the relevance of the CV to the JD's domain.
2. Score the CV based on the JD's requirements, using weights from jd.evaluationConfig and jd.customParameters.
3. Return a structured JSON object in the following format:

{
  "cvScore": Number, // Overall compatibility score between 0 and 100, rounded to an integer
  "evaluationResults": {
    "skillMatches": [
      {
        "skill": "String", // A skill from JD
        "matchStrength": Number // 0 to 100, based on how well this skill is reflected in the CV
      }
    ],
    "experienceScore": Number, // 0 to 100, based on relevance and duration of work experience
    "educationScore": Number, // 0 to 100, based on education match with JD
    "overallScore": Number // Weighted average of scores, rounded to an integer
  }
}

Guidelines:
1. **Relevance Check**:
   - Determine the JD's domain based on jd.jobTitle, jd.jobType, jd.qualifications.skills, and jd.customParameters.
   - Assess the CV's domain by analyzing cv.skills, cv.experience roles, and cv.education field.
   - If the CV's domain is irrelevant to the JD (e.g., finance CV for a MERN stack role), assign a cvScore of 0, set all evaluationResults scores to 0, and return early with an empty skillMatches array.
   - Use contextual clues (e.g., "MERN stack" implies tech, "financial analyst" implies finance) to determine relevance.

2. **Scoring for Relevant CVs**:
   - **Skill Matches**:
     - Compare jd.qualifications.skills and cv.skills (including related technologies and synonyms, e.g., "JavaScript" matches "JS").
     - For each JD skill, assign a matchStrength (0-100) based on presence, proficiency, and relevance in the CV.
     - Include skills from jd.customParameters (e.g., "softSkill") if present, assessing their presence in cv.skills or cv.softSkills.
   - **Experience Score**:
     - Evaluate relevance of cv.experience roles to jd.qualifications.experience and job responsibilities.
     - Consider duration, seniority, and domain-specific experience.
     - Assign a score (0-100) based on alignment and sufficiency.
   - **Education Score**:
     - Compare cv.education (level and field) to jd.qualifications.edification.
     - Assign a score (0-100) based on degree level (e.g., Bachelor's vs. Master's) and field relevance.
   - **Certifications Score**:
     - If jd.evaluationConfig.certifications has a non-zero weight, compare cv.certifications to JD requirements.
     - Assign a Ascolore (0-100) based on relevance and number of matching certifications.
   - **Custom Parameters Score**:
     - For each parameter in jd.customParameters (e.g., { key: "softSkill", value: 25 }), assess its presence in the CV (e.g., in cv.softSkills or cv.experience).
     - Assign a score (0-100) based on relevance and strength of the match.

3. **Weighted Scoring**:
   - Retrieve weights from jd.evaluationConfig (e.g., { skills: 30, experience: 30, education: 20, certifications: 20 }).
   - For each entry in jd.customParameters, use the numeric value as its weight if provided (e.g., { key: "softSkill", value: 25 } contributes 25% weight).
   - Calculate total weight: sum of jd.evaluationConfig weights plus sum of numeric values in jd.customParameters.
   - If total weight != 100, normalize by scaling each weight proportionally (e.g., if total is 125, scale each by 100/125).
   - Calculate overallScore as:
     - (skillsScore * normalizedSkillsWeight) + (experienceScore * normalizedExperienceWeight) + (educationScore * normalizedEducationWeight) + (certificationsScore * normalizedCertificationsWeight) + sum(customParameterScore * normalizedCustomParameterWeight)
     - Round to an integer.
   - Set cvScore equal to overallScore.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If jd.evaluationConfig is missing or incomplete, use default weights based on the experience level required for that job (e.g., for job requiring high experience the experience must be of high weigtage and for the jobs which need freshers the education and skills must of high weightage).
   - If jd.customParameters is empty or contains non-numeric values, ignore those entries for weighting.
   - If certifications are not required (jd.evaluationConfig.certifications = 0), set certificationsScore to 0 and redistribute weights proportionally.
   - Ensure all scores are between 0 and 100.

Only return valid, structured JSON. Do not include explanations, notes, or any extra content.
