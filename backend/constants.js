- qualifications.experience describes required experience.
- qualifications.skills is an array of skills mentioned.
- location specifies the job location.
- compensation.salaryRange includes any salary details mentioned (if available, otherwise leave empty).
- compensation.benefits includes an array of benefits (if available, otherwise leave empty).
- applicationProcess captures how candidates are expected to apply or any application-related notes.

For missing fields (e.g., salary details or benefits), include the property but leave the value as null or an empty array ([]) as appropriate.

Guidelines:
- Extract "personalInfo" details including name, email, phone number, LinkedIn, and portfolio if available.
- For "skills", organize skills into relevant categories like Technical, Soft Skills, Leadership, Management, Research, etc. Use a category that best describes the skills listed in the resume.
- List "experience" with roles, companies, dates, descriptions, and key achievements where applicable.
- Include "education" details with degrees, institutions, and graduation years.
- Add "certifications" with titles, issuing organizations, and issue dates if provided.
- Capture "projects" with brief descriptions, technologies/tools used, and links.
- Extract "achievements" such as awards, recognitions, or honors.
- Include "internships" if mentioned with relevant details.
- Add "references" with names, contact information, and relationships.

If a field is missing or not provided in the input, include the property in the JSON and leave its value as null, an empty string (""), or an empty array ([]), as appropriate.

Ensure:
- All dates follow the format YYYY-MM-DD.
- Arrays are used where specified.
- Skills must be grouped into relevant categories.

export const SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS_CV_JD_COMPARISON = `
You are a highly intelligent evaluation engine that compares a candidate's resume (CV) with a job description (JD) and outputs a structured assessment.
Your task is to assess how well the CV matches the JD, assigning a numeric score and providing detailed evaluation results.
Provide only the valid JSON in the output with no other information in the response.
Be logical, unbiased, and comprehensive in the assessment.
`;

export const TASK_INSTRUCTIONS_CV_JD_COMPARISON = `
You will be given two JSON objects:
- One is a parsed CV (resume)
- The other is a parsed Job Description (JD)

Compare them and return a structured JSON object in the following format:

{
  "cvScore": Number, // Overall compatibility score between 0 and 100

  "evaluationResults": {
    "skillMatches": [
      {
        "skill": "String", // A skill from JD
        "matchStrength": Number // 0 to 100, based on how well this skill is reflected in the CV
      }

    "experienceScore": Number, // 0 to 100 based on relevance and duration of work experience
    "educationScore": Number, // 0 to 100 based on education match with JD
    "overallScore": Number // Final weighted score calculated from skills, experience, and education
  }
}

Guidelines:
- Compare JD.skills to CV.skills (across all categories) and generate a matchStrength for each JD skill.
- Skill matchStrength should consider direct keyword match and related technologies or synonyms.
- For experienceScore:
    - Evaluate relevance of past roles to the JD responsibilities and experience requirements.
    - Consider duration of experience and seniority.
- For educationScore:
    - Compare the education level and field from CV to JD requirements.
- Compute overallScore as a weighted average (e.g., Skills 50%, Experience 30%, Education 20%), then round to an integer.
- The cvScore should be equivalent to overallScore.

Only return valid, structured JSON. Do not include explanations, notes, or any extra content.
